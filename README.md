# Assemblage Bot
This is the backend for my slack bot. Right now it has two tools, random selector and a poll. 

## Using the Random Selector

A simple slash command, just type the following into slack

```
/random choice1, choice2, choice3
```

And a random choice will be selected.

## Using the Poll

The poll is also initiated with a slash command, just type the following

```
/poll title, choice1, choice2, choice3
```

This will generate two message to everyone in the channel, one where they can make their selection and a second with the results of the poll.

Just select you choice, and watch the results update.
